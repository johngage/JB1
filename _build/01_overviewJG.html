Jupyter Notebooks and in markdown.</p>
<p><em><strong>jupyter-book</strong></em> converts book content in
Jupyter Notebook and markdown format to HTML, and then further modifies that HTML (using Jekyll) into a book fit for hosting on the web, either at GitHub, or at any hosting service.</p>
<p>Using additional packages, your book becomes live and interactive, running the Jupyter Notebook content either locally or across the web.  And your mathematical notation is rendered, using .....</p>
<p><em><strong>jupyter-book</strong></em> is a python package that generates book pages in HTML with the <code>jupyter-book build</code> command, and then combines those HTML pages into a book with the <code>make serve</code> command. This second step uses another package, <code>jekyll</code>, to build a table of contents column for the book, and a page contents column for each page. The <code>make serve</code> command also starts a local server on your machine to show your book in your browser.</p>
<p>By pointing your browser to the local address provided by running the <code>jupyter-book serve</code> command, you will see your book, served from your local machine.  That <code>make serve</code> command will continue to run, allowing you to dynamically update book content and see the result immediately in your browser.</p>
<p>Last, to publish your book to the web, you will use a package named <code>ghp-import</code>, which you will run in a separate terminal window because your initial terminal is still running <code>make serve</code>.</p>
<p>Run <code>$ pip install ghp-import</code> once to install the ghp_import package. Though it says "import", it exports your finished HTML pages to GitHub, so GitHub can serve them as a website to the Internet.</p>
<p>Running <code>$ ghp-import -n -p -f _site</code> will push your final HTML files to Github to be published. We'll describe how this works, later, after we describe how to set up your GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Your workflow, from this point on, will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>use your editor to change the local content in the /content directory.  Save your Jupyter notebooks into your local /content directory</li>
<li>save your changes</li>
<li>build your book's HTML with <code>$ jupyter-book build .</code>,  which is executed in your book's directory</li>
<li>look at your book in your browser, using the server running on your local machine with a local address.  See how it looks.</li>
<li>repeat until satisfied</li>
<li>finally, export all the HTML files to GitHub, using <code>ghp-import</code></li>
<li>then, look at your book's website in a second browser window, aimed at your web GitHub account, to see what the world will see.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, it looks like this, using the Atom editor as an example, with your book in the directory <code>JupyterBooks/JBook1</code>:</p>

<pre><code>
$ cd JupyterBooks/JBook1   #move into the home directory for your book
$ atom .   #invoke the Atom editor on the directory, which will create a "project",\
 allowing the Atom editor to show all files in the directory</code></pre>
<p>Edit files in /content</p>
<p>Save</p>
<p>Run <code>$ jupyter-book build .</code></p>
<p>This converts the .md and .ipynb files in /content
into HTML files in _build.  \
These HTML files do not yet have the full page-to-page links needed for a web site.
To create those links:</p>
<p>Run <code>$ make serve</code></p>
<p>This command does a lot.
It converts the HTML files in _build into complete web HTML files in _site, using Jekyll to generate the links.
And, it fires up a server that runs until stopped, that displays the newly-built HTML files in _site.</p>
<p>Open a browser window, go to <code>http://127.0.0.1:4000/JBook1</code></p>
<p>See how your book looks.  Check the links.</p>
<p>If you make a change to a file in /content, open a new Terminal window in the JBook1 directory.</p>
<p>Run <code>$ jupyter-book build .</code></p>
<p>(or <code>$ make build</code> , which does the same thing).</p>
<p>Then, just reload the browser to see the result; the server is still running in the other window.
(On Mac, use <code>Command-Shift-R</code>; on PC, <code>Control-Shift-R</code>)</p>
<p>Now, to move all the files in _site up to the GitHub server, and make sure GitHub knows where to find them.</p>
<p>Run <code>$ ghp-import -n -p -f _site</code></p>
<p>In another browser window, go to <code>https://yourname.github.io/JBook1</code></p>
<p>See how it looks. Check the links.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>

<pre><code>And, when you're used to using the CLI, here's what it looks like after you save your edits and the server is running:

$ !j  # Now you can see the updated book locally.
$ !g  # Now you can see the updated book published on the web.</code></pre>
<h2 id="Installing-jupyter-book">Installing <em>jupyter-book</em><a class="anchor-link" href="#Installing-jupyter-book"> </a></h2><p>You will use a terminal interface: on a Mac, use Terminal or iTerm; on a PC, use .........  We will call it the "command-line interface", or CLI. We use '$' to indicate the beginning of the command line.</p>
<p>The Jupyter-Book CLI allows you to create, build, upgrade, and otherwise control your
Jupyter Book. You can install it via <code>pip</code> with the following command that you can execute anywhere:</p>

<pre><code>$ pip install jupyter-book</code></pre>
<p>Next, create a directory in a convenient place to contain your Jupyter Books. Inside that directory, each book will live in its own directory.</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir JupyterBooks
$ cd JupyterBooks</code></pre>
<h2 id="A-quick-tour-of-a-Jupyter-Book">A quick tour of a Jupyter Book<a class="anchor-link" href="#A-quick-tour-of-a-Jupyter-Book"> </a></h2><p>Jupyter-Book comes with a demo book so that you can see how the content files
are used in the book. We'll begin with a quick tour of these files, as they are
the pieces that you'll modify for your own book.   Build a quick book to get the idea, using the commands below, and then build your own book using the example as a template.</p>
<p>Create a <strong>demo Jupyter Book</strong>. Run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ jupyter-book create JBook1 --demo</code></pre>
<p>A new directory containing the demo book will be created at the path that you've given (in this case, <code>JupyterBooks/JBook1</code>).  If JBook1 already exists, it won't let you overwrite it; just rename the JBook1 directory to something else, so <code>jupyter-book</code> can create the <code>JBook1</code> directory and fill it with the demo files.</p>
<p>Let's take a quick look at some important files in the demo book you created:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd JBook1
$ ls</code></pre>
<p>Here's what it looks like, showing all the files:</p>

<pre><code>JBook1/
├── assets
│   └── custom
│       ├── custom.css
│       └── custom.js
├── _config.yml
├── content
│   ├── features
│   │  ├── features.md
│   │  └── notebooks.ipynb
│   └── LICENSE.md
├── _data
│   └── toc.yml
└── requirements.txt</code></pre>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of the files you can modify for yourself, and that
ultimately make up your book.</p>
<h3 id="Book-configuration">Book configuration<a class="anchor-link" href="#Book-configuration"> </a></h3><p>All of the configuration for your book is in the following file:</p>

<pre><code>JBook1/
├── _config.yml</code></pre>
<p>The key fields to define so that the web links are built correctly are <code>url</code> and <code>baseurl</code>.
<code>url</code> should be the URL for your GitHub account, and look like <code>url: yourname.github.io</code>. baseurl is the name of your remote repository, and should look like <code>/JBook1</code> .</p>
<p>You can define metadata for your book (such as its title), add
a book logo, turn on different "interactive" buttons (such as a
Binder button for pages built from a Jupyter Notebook), and more.</p>
<h3 id="Book-content">Book content<a class="anchor-link" href="#Book-content"> </a></h3><p>Your book's content can be found in the <code>content/</code> folder. Some content
files for the demo book are shown below:</p>

<pre><code>JBook1/
├── content
    └── features
       ├── features.md
       └── notebooks.ipynb</code></pre>
<p>Note that the content files are either <strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong> or <strong>Markdown</strong>
files. These are the files that define "pages" in your book.</p>
<p>You can store these files in whatever collection of folders you'd like, note that
the <em>structure</em> of your book when it is built will depend solely on the order of
items in your <code>_data/toc.yml</code> file (see below section)</p>
<h3 id="Table-of-Contents-is-defined-in-_data/toc.yml">Table of Contents is defined in <code>_data/toc.yml</code><a class="anchor-link" href="#Table-of-Contents-is-defined-in-_data/toc.yml"> </a></h3><p>Jupyter Book uses your toc.yml file to define the structure of your book--- for example, your chapters, sub-chapters, pages in chapters, etc.</p>
<p>The Table of Contents definition lives at this location:</p>

<pre><code>JBook1/
├── _data
    └── toc.yml</code></pre>
<p>This is a YAML file listing a collection of pages, each one linking to a
file in your <code>content/</code> folder. Here's an example of a few pages defined in <code>toc.yml</code>.
It's very fussy about indentation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">title</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Features and customization</span>

    <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">url</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">/features/markdown</span>
    <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">not_numbered</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">true</span>
  <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">title</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Jupyter notebooks</span>
    <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">url</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">/features/notebooks</span>
    <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">not_numbered</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">true</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The top-most level of your TOC file are <strong>book chapters</strong>. Above, this is the
"Features and customization" page. Each chapter can have
several sections (defined in <code>sections:</code>) and each section can have several sub-sections
(which would be define with a deeper level of <code>sections:</code>). In addition, you can
use a few extra YAML values to control the behavior of Jupyter-Book (for example,
<code>not_numbered: true</code> will prevent Jupyter Book from numbering the pages in that chapter).</p>
<p>Each item in the YAML file points to a single content file. The links
should be <strong>relative to the <code>/content/</code> folder and with no extension, no .md or .ipynb.</strong></p>
<p>For example, in the example above there is a file in
<code>JBook1/content/features/notebooks.ipynb</code>. The TOC entry that points to
this file is here:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">title</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Jupyter notebooks</span>
        <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">url</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">/features/notebooks</span>
</pre></div>
<h3 id="A-license-for-your-content">A license for your content<a class="anchor-link" href="#A-license-for-your-content"> </a></h3><p>When you share content online, it's a good idea to add a license so that others know
what rights you retain to the work. This can make your book more sharable and (re)usable.</p>
<p>The license for a Jupyter Book lives in this location:</p>

<pre><code>JBook1/
├── content
    └── LICENSE.md</code></pre>
<p>When you create a new book, if you don't specify a license, then <code>jupyter-book</code> will by default
add a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International</a>
(CC BY-SA 4.0) license to your book. CC BY-SA requires attribution of
your work, and also requires that any derivations someone creates are released
under a license <em>at least as permissive</em> as CC BY-SA.</p>
<p>If you'd like to choose a different license, you can add whatever text you like to the file
in <code>/content/LICENSE.md</code>. We commend checking out the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses">Creative Commons licenses page</a>
for several options for licenses that may suit your needs.</p>
<h3 id="Book-code-requirements-files">Book code requirements files<a class="anchor-link" href="#Book-code-requirements-files"> </a></h3><p>Since your Jupyter Book likely has computational material specified in Jupyter
Notebooks, you should specify the packages needed to run your Jupyter Book.
In this case, we use a <code>requirements.txt</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>JBook1/
└── requirements.txt</code></pre>
<p>The demo book uses <code>requirements.txt</code> because it has Python code, but you can
include any other files that you'd like to.</p>
<h3 id="Book-bibliography-for-citations">Book bibliography for citations<a class="anchor-link" href="#Book-bibliography-for-citations"> </a></h3><p>If you'd like to build a bibliography for your book, you can do so by including
the following file:</p>

<pre><code>JBook1/
├── _bibliography
    └── references.bib</code></pre>
<p>This BiBTex file can be used along with the <code>jekyll-scholar</code> extension. For more information
on how to use citations in Jupyter Book, see <a href="../features/citations">Citations with Jupyter Book</a></p>
<h3 id="Custom-Javascript-and-CSS">Custom Javascript and CSS<a class="anchor-link" href="#Custom-Javascript-and-CSS"> </a></h3><p>These are the files in this location:</p>

<pre><code>├── assets
    └── custom
        ├── custom.css
        └── custom.js</code></pre>
<p>Jupyter Book lets you supply your own CSS and Javascript that will be
built into your book. Feel free to edit these files with whatever you like.</p>
